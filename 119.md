# Project Euler 119 - Digit power sum

[Problem statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=119)  

We iterate over all possible bases and exponents and return the 30th number satisfying the requirements. We may use Python and take advantage of its handling of very large numbers.

    import time
    start = time.time()
    ans = []  # store all the numbers satisfying the requirements
    for p in range(2, 10):  # iterate over each exponent
      for n in range(2, 100):  # iterate over the possible bases
          if n == sum([int(i) for i in str(n ** p)]):  # if the digit sum is equal to n
              ans.append(n ** p)
              if len(ans) > 30:  # found 30 numbers, exit now
                  break

    ans = sorted(ans)  # let's make sure the numbers are in the correct order
    print(ans[29])
    print("time elapsed:", time.time() - start, "ms")
