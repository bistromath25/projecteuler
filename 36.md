# Project Euler 36 - Double-base palindromes

[Problem statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=36)  

We just loop up to 1'000'000 and add to our sum the numbers which are palindromes in base 10 and base 2. In Python, we can just put all of those values into a list, and then print the sum of that list.

```Python
print(sum([i for i in range(1000000) if str(i) == str(i)[::-1] and str(bin(i)).replace("0b", "") == str(bin(i)).replace("0b", "")[::-1]]))
```
