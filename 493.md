# Project Euler 493 - Under The Rainbow

[Problem statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=493)  

By symmetry the probabilities of selecting a ball from each of the 7 different colors (of the rainbow) is the same, let it be *p*. Then the total probability is 7*p*. 

Consider the red balls, of which there are 10, so there are 60 non-red balls. There are 60C20 ways of selecting no red balls out of 70C20 total ways of selecting any balls, hence there are 1 - 60C20 / 70C20 ways of selecting at least one red ball.

Thus *p* = 1 - 60C20 / 70C20 and so 7*p* = 7(1 - 60C20 / 70C20).
