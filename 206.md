# Project Euler 206 - Concealed Square

[Problem statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=206)  

We are asked to determine the unique positive integer whose square has the form `1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_0`, where each underscore represents a single digit.
Clearly, the number must end in `00` (which is achieved by 10 squared), and so we now find an integer whose square is `1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9` and multiply that integer by 10 at the very end.
Now, as the square ends in a 9, the integer must end in a 3 or a 7 - we can simply iterate over all possible odd numbers ending in 3 or 7 and return whichever fullfills our requirements.

    import math
    def check(i):
        s = str(i)
        return all(int(s[x * 2]) == x + 1 for x in range(0, 9))

    i = 138902663  # square root of the largest possible number, 19293949596979899
    while not check(i * i):
        if i % 10 == 7:
            i -= 4
        elif i % 10 == 3:
            i -= 6
        else:
            i -= 2

    print("answer:", i * 10)
