# Project Euler 293 - Pseudo-Fortunate Numbers

[Problem statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=293) 

The general consensus in the solutions forums is that this problem was worded very oddly. To specify, an "admissible" number can be factorized into a chain of "consecutive" primes, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, however 3, 5, 7 does not count. We could see this by noting that 15 = 3 x 5 is absent from the list, but probably the problem statement should've mentioned this. Now that we know what we're searching for it's just a matter of bruteforcing primes. As the limit is 10<sup>9</sup>, then the largest prime factor we have will be 23.
