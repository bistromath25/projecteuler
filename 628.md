# Project Euler 628 - Open chess positions

[Problem statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=628)

We are given the definition of an "Open chess position" and we must determine how many such positions there are on a chess board with side length 10<sup>8</sup>.

Notice that there are, in total, n! possible positions. Of these n! positions we will count how many are closed i.e. not open.

A position is closed if there is a diagonal chain of pawns separating the lower-left portion of the board from the upper-right portion - the rook cannot move across this chain, therefore the board is split into two parts. We shall denote by I the diagaonal chains which connect the left and bottom sides, II the chain which connect the top and right sides, and III the chain that connects the top left corner with the bottom right corner. Not that there are equal numbers of type I and II chains, but only one of type III. 

For each of 1 &leq; i &lt; n, there is only one type I chain containing i pawns, and the number of positions that include this chain is (n - i)!. From above there are also the same number of type II chains (since in reality I and II are just mirrors of each other).

If 1 &leq; i, j &lt; n and i + j &leq; n then it is also possible to have position featuring a type I chain of i pawns *and* a type II chain of j pawns (this is not difficult to believe as these chains can be formed independent of the other), resulting in a total of (n - i - j)! positions with two such chains.

We will apply the Inclusion-Exclusion principle in order to count the number of closed positions.

Thus the number of closed positions is 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(n-i)! + 1 - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n-j}(n-i-j)! = n! - (n-3)\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}i! - 2.

Subtracting this from the total n! yields f(n) = (n-3)\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}i! + 2.
