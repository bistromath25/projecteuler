# Project Euler 28 - Number spiral diagonals

[Problem statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=28)  

Consider an n-by-n grid formed this way. The top right corner has value n<sup>2</sup>, and the top left corner is n - 1 less than the top right corner. As well, the bottom left corner is n - 1 less than the top left corner, and the bottom right corner is in turn n - 1 less than the bottom left corner (as there are n - 1 numbers in between each subsequence corner). Since we are only considering the diagonals, then we can consider each square, and just sum up the values of its corners for that diaganal length. Additionally, by construction only squares of odd side lengths are created, and so all n can be written 2m + 1. 
Hence the n'th concentric square has a corner sum of (2m + 1)<sup>2</sup> + ((2m + 1)<sup>2</sup> - 2m) + ((2m + 1)<sup>2</sup> - 4m) + ((2m + 1)<sup>2</sup> - 6m) = 16m<sup>2</sup> + 4m + 4. We can compute this sum for the first 500 squares.
