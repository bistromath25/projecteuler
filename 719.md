# Project Euler 719 - Number Splitting

[Problem statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=719)

Iterate over all squares up to 10<sup>12</sup> and check if any of their partitions sum to the its square root. It's possible to speed things up a bit by observing that splitting numbers in this way preserves the digit sum, and hence the value modulo 9. Therefore we need to find all n with n &equiv; \sqrt{n} (mod 9). It turns out this is only true when \sqrt{n} (mod 9) equals 0 or 1.
