# Project Euler 277 - A Modified Collatz sequence

[Problem statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=277)

Observe that if a<sub>1</sub> is the first term in our modified Collatz sequence, then a<sub>31</sub> is the number resulting from the repeated application of the operations denoted by the string `UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd`. We can determine a<sub>1</sub> by applying the operations in reverse from a<sub>31</sub>, yielding a<sub>1</sub> = 205891132094649a<sub>31</sub> + 21110037246199) / 4194304.

Thus we seek a solution to a<sub>1</sub> = 205891132094649x + 96521732651065, which exceeds the given limit when x = 5.
